Static variable - It is a class level variable. When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level. Memory allocation for such variables only happens once when the class is loaded in the memory. Hence, they are useful when we need to do memory management. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable. Static variables are executed in order they are present in a program.
Final variable - If we declare a variable as final, we cannot modify the value of the variable in our program, thus we make it constant. A final variable that has no value it is called blank final variable or uninitialized final variable. It can be initialized in the constructor only. The blank final variable can be static also which will be initialized in the static block only.
